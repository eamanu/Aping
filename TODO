=========================

------ LEGEND -----
[ ] todo
[\] started
[X] done
?[ ] to be discussed?
![ ] important!
-------------------


Output:
    [ ] Better output for ICMP unreachable messages (and similars)! They're *NOT* ping replies!!
    [ ] Increase effect of verbosity levels
   ?[ ] XML output?

Features:   
    [\] small DNS client to let the user choose his own DNS servers
    [ ] TCP/UDP ping for non-root users
    [ ] Multiple targets specification
        [ ] Better broadcast pings support (option)
        [ ] Network masks (192.168.1.0/24, www.google.com/24)
        [ ] Ranges of IP addresses (192.168.1-3.15-32)
   ?[ ] ICMP type 10 (router sollicitation)?
   ?[ ] IPV6 support?
    
Code maturity:
    [\] Reach a first stable state
        [X] Command line bug fixes
        [ ] behaviour testing
        [ ] special cases testing (bugged targets, stressed network...)
   ![ ] Faster (eg. signal handler) this will require non-blocking sockets and select() but were really better!!!


KNOWN BUGS : 

    [ ] On freeBSD, signals are processed in a different way, and two ctrl+C are required to close aping.
        Description is available here : http://bugs.python.org/issue1975

    [ ] On freeBSD, there is still a pb pinging localhost, unreplied packets stay in the buffer...

    [ ] If listening timeout (-o option) is too short, APing misses the first reply (OK) but keeps it
        and read it as a reply for next probe, this is a wrong behavior, buffer must be flushed and emptied
        between each probe!!
